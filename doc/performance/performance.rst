Serialization and deserialization performance of orjson is better than ultrajson, rapidjson, simplejson, or json. The benchmarks are done on fixtures of real data:

* twitter.json, 631.5KiB, results of a search on Twitter for "ä¸€", containing CJK strings, dictionaries of strings and arrays of dictionaries, indented.

* github.json, 55.8KiB, a GitHub activity feed, containing dictionaries of strings and arrays of dictionaries, not indented.

* citm_catalog.json, 1.7MiB, concert data, containing nested dictionaries of strings and arrays of integers, indented.

* canada.json, 2.2MiB, coordinates of the Canadian border in GeoJSON format, containing floats and arrays, indented.
