This repository is a copy of the benchmark to measure the performance and correctness of Python JSON libraries. It was copied and inspired from Orjson_.

.. _Orjson: https://github.com/ijl/orjson

The goal is, using Poetry and Tox, to simplify the execution of the test and thus enable everyone to run the benchmark quickly.

Furthermore, further steps were taken to improve it, such as naming the version used and structuring the readme file into different sub-files.
